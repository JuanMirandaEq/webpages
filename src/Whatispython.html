<h3>1.1. What is Python?</h3>
<p>Python is a programming language; it is a way to instruct a computer to perform different kinds of tasks. Python is a free software, it can be freely used, modified, and redistributed. It is a general purpose language and it is used for building software in:</p>
<ul >
<li>Web applications</li>
<li>Desktop applications</li>
<li>Scientific and numeric computing</li>
<li>Cybersecurity</li>
</ul>
<p>Python uses high-level language. It contains easy-to-read syntax for the user (to simplify computer programming) that is later converted into a low-level language to provide instructions to the computer.</p>
<p> Python is an object-oriented language. Objects are one of the foundations to program in Python, they are collections of data that have specific attributes and methods which are determined procedures that can be performed to them. For example, if a dog were an object, its attributes would be its height, weight, color and age and its methods would be to run, to sleep, to eat and to bark.</p>
<p>Dates are actual Python objects, it has some attributes like day, month and year and one of its methods is day_name, which uses the date data to convert the day digit into the day name.  If the date object is for example 27/7/2022 the attribute day is 27, month is 7 and year 2022. If the method day_name is used python performs procedures to determine which is name of the day corresponding to the date 27/7/2022, Tuesday.</p>
<p> In the shell below, there are examples of attributes and methods. To use an attribute or a method. First type the name of the object followed by a dot and the name of the attribute or the method. Methods are always followed by parenthesis</p>
